# Iterative Model Development Log: Median Operator (V2)

## Experiment 1: Baseline (Full Sort)
- **Algorithm**: `Bitonic Sort` (for $N \le 1024$) and `Radix Sort` + Gather (for $N > 1024$).
- **Hyperparameters**: `BLOCK_N = next_power_of_2(N)` for bitonic, 8-bit passes for radix sort.
- **Scores**: 
  - Shape `(1024, 64)`: ~0.09x speedup vs PyTorch.
  - Shape `(1024, 512)`: ~0.50x speedup vs PyTorch.
- **Insights**: Sorting the entire array is excessively slow ($O(N \log^2 N)$ or $O(N \log N)$), whereas PyTorch uses an $O(N)$ selection algorithm (like QuickSelect).

## Experiment 2: QuickSelect Prototype
- **Algorithm**: `QuickSelect` in Triton.
- **Insights**: Prototyping revealed that recursive/stack-based QuickSelect is highly divergent and extremely difficult to map efficiently to GPU SIMT execution models natively within Triton. Memory access patterns were heavily uncoalesced, leading to poor cache performance.

## Experiment 3: Radix Select in Registers
- **Algorithm**: `Radix Select` (Selection by counting bits from MSB to LSB).
- **Hyperparameters**: 
  - `bits_per_pass`: 1 bit per pass.
  - `num_passes`: 32 for Float32.
  - `BLOCK_N = next_power_of_2(N)` (fit entirely in SRAM/registers).
  - Maximum Supported $N$: 4096.
- **Scores**:
  - Because it requires exactly 32 constant-time passes instead of $O(\log^2 N)$ passes (e.g., ~100 passes for $N=1024$), instruction count is vastly reduced.
  - Speedup increased significantly to **~1.1x - 1.5x** over PyTorch for medium $N$ sizes ($\le 4096$), matching and often exceeding the PyTorch baseline.
- **Insights**: Radix Select leverages the GPU's high-speed counting instructions (popc) and reduces the operation to pure arithmetic and masking without any memory round-trips for intermediate bins, making it ideal for the `median` reduction!
